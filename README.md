## Week 1: Laser cutting

**Goal**: Using Fusion360 to design the patterns, cut the board using laser cutting and assemble them.

**Show**: 

1. Design

## Week 2: 3D priting

**Goal**: Design an object that can not be laser-cutted.

**Analysis**: Mathematically speaking, a non-laser-cutted object  can not be projected onto a plane without information losses. Selecting a 3D curve arbitrarily you can always get such a curve. I prefer **Double Helix**, an elegant curve which presents the structure of DNA.

And the parameters are well tuned such that at every point on the curve, the slope is exactly 60 degree which means that the curve doesn't need any support.

> A brief proof: The diameter is 40mm, thus the height of curve should be $40*pi*\sqrt{3}/2=108.82$mm, so I set the height as 110mm.

## week 5: 3D scanning

**Goal**: Scan your head, adapt it and print.

**Show**:

I open a tube in my head and add some blood. A bullet went through this guy's head but he kept calm.
